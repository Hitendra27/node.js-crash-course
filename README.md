"Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment." - Nodejs.dev Docs
This sounds like a cool, straightforward answer. But for a beginner, this definition might raise further questions. So let's break it down and understand what it means.

Node.js is open-source: This means that the source code for Node.js is publicly available. And it's maintained by contributors from all over the world. The Node.js contribution guide shows you how to contribute.

Node.js is cross-platform: Node.js is not dependent on any operating system software. It can work on Linux, macOS, or Windows.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment: When you write JavaScript code in your text editor, that code cannot perform any task unless you execute (or run) it. And to run your code, you need a runtime environment.

Browsers like Chrome and Firefox have runtime environments. That is why they can run JavaScript code. Before Node.js was created, JavaScript could only run in a browser. And it was used to build only front-end applications.

Node.js provides a runtime environment outside of the browser. It's also built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine. This makes it possible to build back-end applications using the same JavaScript programming language you may be familiar with.
